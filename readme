First of all, take a look at the attached code

I've coded it inside el little client class for simplicity. In this way is also easier (and cleaner) to handle timers and timeouts.

It handles two type co PING: Websocket level and application level.

I've tested reconnection by turning off my wifi connection after 15 seconds program detects failure and then (after you re - enable wifi) it reconnects to server.

I'll be testing low level ping in deeper detail though.

Also, let me know IP binding, it should be easy!

I'm interested in API you mentioned, can you give me more details about functionality, required primitives, etc?

Ricardo
